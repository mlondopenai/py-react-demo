# How to start the server
Ensure that both PyReact and FastAPI are installed in your working environment. Once the dependencies are set up, you can start the server using the following command:

uvicorn main:app --reload

This command will launch the FastAPI application in development mode, with automatic reloading enabled for code changes.
